      In a programming language, the Assign block would be represented by an "=" sign. So the above block would be:

      $result = $Display_Text
variables:
  - name: result
    required: false
    isInput: false
    isOutput: true
    level: INTERMEDIATE
    type:
      type: string
    value: '""'
  - name: Display_Text
    required: true
    isInput: true
    isOutput: false
    level: INTERMEDIATE
    type:
      type: string
    value: '"Hello World"'

    This workflow shows an example of value to variable assignment in Pliant. The flow has an output variable called "result" (referenced within the flow as $result). Output variables are returned at the end of the flow execution. There is an input variable called "Display_Text" (referenced within the flow as $Display_Text) that starts with a default value of "Hello World"
    The flow has a single assign block, which takes the value of the $Display_Text variable and assigns it to the $result variable.
